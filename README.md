# Iris-data

Data Set Information :

The Iris dataset was used in R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper, The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems, and can also be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.

The columns in this dataset are:

                                  1. Id
                                  2. SepalLengthCm
                                  3. SepalWidthCm
                                  4. PetalLengthCm
                                  5. PetalWidthCm
                                  6. Species
                                  
                                  
                                  
This is a famous dataset, everyone who begins a data science as a carrer must be able to learn from this data set, clearly explained with steps.


Anyone can use this jupyter file for reference, data set included with this respository.
